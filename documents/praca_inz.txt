Wprowadzenie - opis systemów rozpoznawania twarzy, gdzie sie je wykorzystuje, co to jest face spoofing, metody face spoofingu (zdjecie, film, maska 3d), zapotrzebowanie na systemy anty spoofingowe

Rozdział 1. Metody face spoofingu

Podział na 2D oraz 3D
2D:
- print attack: photo/poster/A4
- paper cut: paper mask in different positions
- replay attack: PC/Pad/Phone

3D:
- mask 3d

Rozdział 2. Techniki anti spoofingu:
- sensor based (hardware based) - eg. infrared sensors (iphone FaceID)
- features based (texture analysis - analyze color-texture information from the luminance and the chrominance channels)
- score based (machine learning)
- faze liveness detection (motion analysis)


Rozdział 3. Bazy danych anty spoofingu
CelabAspoof:
CelebA-Spoof is a large-scale face anti-spoofing dataset that has 625,537 images from 10,177 subjects, which includes 43 rich attributes on face, illumination, environment and spoof types.
Among 43 rich attributes, 40 attributes belong to live images including all facial components and accessories such as skin, nose, eyes, eyebrows, lip, hair, hat, eyeglass. 3 attributes belong to spoof images including spoof types, environments and illumination conditions.

Illumination condition and enironment:
Indoor/ Outdoor
Normal/Strong/Back/Dark


Inne parametry datasetu:
Five Angles: All spoof type need to traverse all five types of angles including ''vertical'', ''down'', ''up'', ''forward'' and ''backward''. The angle of inclination is between [-30°, 30°].
Four Shapes: There are a total of four shapes, ''normal'', ''inside'', ''outside'' and ''corner''.
Four Sensors: We collected 24 popular devices with four types, ''PC'', ''camera'', ''tablet'' and ''phone''


Inne datasety:
- CASIA Face Anti-Spooﬁng Database(CASIA FASD) 
- Replay-Attack Database
these two consist of recordings ofreal client accesses and various spooﬁng attack attempts captured with differentimaging qualities, including mobile phones, webcams, and digital system cameras

Przykład potrzeby systemu anty spoofingowego:
- For example, in Hong Kong, a young passenger boarded a plane while wearing an old-man mask and arrived in Canada to claim asylum in 2010
